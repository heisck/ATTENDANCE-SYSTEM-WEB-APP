# Note on IP-based Access Control
# This application supports checking if students are on campus via IP ranges.
# Configure trusted IP ranges in the admin dashboard, not via environment variables.
# The application expects to be behind a trusted reverse proxy that sets:
# - X-Forwarded-For header: Client's original IP
# - X-Real-IP header: Alternative IP header (fallback)
# 
# Trusted reverse proxies include:
# - Vercel (automatically sets X-Forwarded-For)
# - Render.com (automatically sets X-Forwarded-For)
# - Netlify (sets proxy headers)
# - Custom NGINX/Apache proxies (if configured correctly)
#
# IMPORTANT: Only trust these headers if your application is behind a trusted proxy!
# Misconfiguration allows attackers to spoof their location.

# Email Configuration (Optional, for password reset and verification)
# Example: mailgun, sendgrid, resend, or other email providers
# EMAIL_PROVIDER="sendgrid"
# EMAIL_API_KEY="your-api-key"
# EMAIL_FROM="noreply@example.com"
